# Pokeweb
Pokeweb is an free online pokedex.
<hr>

## How to use it
To search a pokemon, write on lower case, or use its code without the '#'.
The search is focus based, so for it to work, you need to click out or use tab.
( it was a requisite on this exercice )


To start the pokedex, click on it, it will open.
To close pokedex, click on it's tab, it will restart.

The "estou com sorte" button finds a random pokemon, then saves it on a list so it wont show it again.
this list has persistence, to reset it, you need to clean browser cache memory. ( the random pokemon go from 1 to 893, but you can acess the others
with search or next button )
